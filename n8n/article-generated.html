Your NDIS plan outlines the supports and services you need to live independently, participate in your community, and pursue your interests. In this article, we'll take you through the ins and outs of your NDIS plan, providing you with a comprehensive guide to make the most of your plan.</p> <h3>What is an NDIS Plan?</h3> <p>An NDIS plan is a personalised plan that outlines the support and services you need to achieve your goals and improve your quality of life. It's a unique plan that's tailored to your individual needs and aspirations. Your plan is developed in collaboration with your Local Area Coordinator (LAC) and other professionals who know you well. This plan helps you to access a wide range of supports and services, including equipment, home modifications, and support workers, to name a few.</p> <h3>How is My NDIS Plan Developed?</h3> <p>Developing your NDIS plan is a collaborative process that involves several steps:</p> <ul> <li>Initial Planning Meeting: This is where you meet with your LAC to discuss your goals, aspirations, and current situation.</li> <li>Capacity Building Programme: You'll participate in a capacity building programme to help you develop skills and knowledge to achieve your goals.</li> <li>Plan Development: Your LAC will work with you to develop a draft plan that outlines the supports and services you need.</li> <li>Plan Review: Your plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure you're receiving the right supports and services.</li> </ul> <h3>What's Included in My NDIS Plan?</h3> <p>As an NDIS participant, your plan will include:</p> <ul> <li>Goals: These are the specific outcomes you want to achieve through your plan.</li> <li>Supports and Services: These are the specific supports and services you'll receive to help you achieve your goals.</li> <li> Budget: This outlines the amount of funding allocated to your plan and how it will be used.</li> </ul> <h3>Plan Management: What Does it Mean for Me?</h3> <p>Plan management refers to the process of managing your NDIS budget and arranging supports and services.
